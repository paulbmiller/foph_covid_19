# FOPH_Covid_19

## Description
This is a set of functions to analyze the data from the data present directly on the [FOPH Covid-19 website](covid19.admin.ch), instead of using a github repo like my other [Covid-19 repo](https://github.com/paulbmiller/covid_19). This gives us more data to work with, such as the vaccination data.

At this time, I've implemented some functions to check that the sums of some columns for cantons are consistent with values found for CH in the tables. I've also done some basic visualizations with matplotlib of full-vaccinations and a SARIMA model to forecast vaccinations.
