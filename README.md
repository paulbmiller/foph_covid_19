# Covid_19_admin

## Description
This is a set of functions to analyze the data from the data present directly on the [FOPH Covid-19 website](covid19.admin.ch), instead of using a github repo like my other [Covid-19 repo](https://github.com/paulbmiller/covid_19). This gives us more data to work with, such as the vaccination data.
